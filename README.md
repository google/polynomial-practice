# Polynomial Practice

This repository contains an interactive web page that asks you to multiply
polynomials and tells you how you did.

```txt
                 (x² – 8)(–x² – 1) = [–x⁴ + 7x² + 8  ] ✅
                     9(–4x² – 5x) = [–36x² – 45x    ] ✅
                (–10x + 1)(–3x – 3) = [30x² – 27x – 3 ] ❌
```

Detailed instructions are at the top of the page.
